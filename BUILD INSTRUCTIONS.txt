***BUILD INSTRUCTIONS FOR VS2008 On 64-BIT MACHINES***



Actually worked on 06/May/2015

-- If it complains about lacking certain executables or libraries during build, the paths must be modified.

--Go to Tool -> Options -> Projects and Solutions -> VC++ Directories -> Executable files.

-- Add C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0A\Bin

-- Then -> Library files. Add C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1A\Lib



-- BAPSSetup fails to build

This seems to use some setup dialogue frames etc - BAPS has a custom one which it used to copy into
Program Files (!).
In the post WinXP days, this isn't really feasible so it must be put there manually.

The file VsdServiceCredentials1Dlg.wid needs copying to C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\Tools\Deployment\VsdDialogs\0 and 1033.
The entire (yes, entire) VsdDialogs path may also need
 copying to the not-x86 path. Maybe the other way around.

To use the BAPSSetupV2, you will need to install the follow (or equivalent for your version of VS):
